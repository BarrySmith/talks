\begin{frame}{Multigrid advice}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Rapid coarsening is essential for weak scalability
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Push the algorithm towards ``multilevel domain decomposition''
    \end{itemize}
  \item Energy minimizing interpolants
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Similar to exotic Schwarz methods, see Dohrmann and Widlund 2008, 2009
    \item Closely related to FETI-DP/BDDC coarse spaces
    \end{itemize}
  \item Interpolation operators must be compatible with physics (e.g. inf-sup conditions)
  \item Ordering of unknowns can make incomplete factorization behave \\
    similar to line smoothers
  \item Nonlinear multigrid (FAS) is worth trying if pointwise or block \\
    residuals are cheap, or globalization is especially challenging
  \item Monotone multigrid (Kornhuber) for variational inequalities
  \item Boundary conditions in subdomain problems (``optimized Schwarz'')
  \end{itemize}
