\begin{frame}{Verification and Validation}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Verification of code
    \begin{itemize}
    \item check that design order of the method is realized
    \item confirms that method is implemented correctly \\
      and the analysis of the method is correct
    \item manufactured solutions do not provide a proof, \\
      but are convincing as long as all terms are exercised
    \end{itemize}
  \item Verification of a computation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a posteriori error estimates
    \item checking for mesh independence
    \item quantification of uncertainty from discretization and geometry/boundary conditions/materials
    \end{itemize}
  \item Validation of a computation
    \begin{itemize}
    \item needs high-quality laboratory/field measurements
    \item tests the quality of the continuum model
    \end{itemize}
