\begin{frame}{The Roadmap}
  \begin{block}{Hardware trends}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item More cores (keep hearing $\bigO(1000)$ per node)
    \item Long vector registers (already 32 bytes for AVX and BG/Q)
    \item Must use SMT to hide memory latency
    \item Must use SMT for floating point performance (GPU, BG/Q)
    \item Large penalty for non-contiguous memory access
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{``Free flops'', but how can we use them?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item High order methods good: better accuracy per storage
    \item High order methods bad: work unit gets larger
    \item GPU threads have very little memory, must keep work unit small
    \item Need library composability, keep user contribution embarrassingly parallel
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
