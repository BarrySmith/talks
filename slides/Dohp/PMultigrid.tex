\begin{frame}{One level of $p$-multigrid}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Want to skip assembly on finest level (for better throughput)
  \item High order operators lack $h$-ellipticity
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Necessary and sufficient condition for existence of pointwise smoother
    \end{itemize}
  \item Use embedded low-order operator as smoother
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Rescaled to recover a consistent inner product
    \item Does not destroy symmetry for point-block Jacobi
    \end{itemize}
  \item Polynomial smoothers
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Target upper part of PBJacobi-preconditioned spectrum
    \item Efficient GPU implementation
    \end{itemize}
  \item Reordered incomplete factorization to couple ``columns''
  \item Operator-dependent interpolation is more delicate
  \item Strict semi-coarsening requires semi-structured grid
  \end{itemize}
