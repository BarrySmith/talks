\begin{frame}[shrink=5]{Everything is better as a smoother (sometimes)}
  \begin{block}{Block preconditioners work alright, but\ldots}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item nested iteration requires more dot products
    \item more iterations: coarse levels don't ``see'' each other
    \item finer grained kernels: lower arithmetic intensity, even more limited by memory bandwidth
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Coupled multigrid}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item need compatible coarsening
      \begin{itemize}
      \item can do algebraically (Adams 2004) but would need to assemble
      \end{itemize}
    \item stability issues for lowest order $Q_1-P_0^{\text{disc}}$
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Rannacher-Turek looks great, but no discrete Korn's inequality
      \end{itemize}
    \item coupled ``Vanka'' smoothers difficult to implement with high performance, especially for FEM
    \item block preconditioners as smoothers reuse software better
    \item one level by reducing order for the coarse space, more levels need non-nested geometric MG or go all-algebraic and pay for matrix assembly and setup
    \end{itemize}
