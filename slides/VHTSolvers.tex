  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:vhtblock}
    J =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      J_{uu} & J_{up} & J_{uE} \\
      J_{pu} & 0 & 0 \\
      J_{Eu} & J_{Ep} & J_{EE}
    \end{pmatrix} .
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[$J_{uu}$] Viscous/momentum terms, nearly symmetric, variable coefficionts, anisotropy from Newton.
  \item[$J_{up}$] Weak pressure gradient, viscosity dependence on pressure (small), gravitational contribution (pressure-induced density variation).
    Large, nearly balanced by gravitational forcing.
  \item[$J_{uE}$] Viscous dependence on energy, very nonlinear, not very large.
  \item[$J_{pu}$] Divergence (mass conservation), nearly equal to $J_{up}^T$.
  \item[$J_{Eu}$] Sensitivity of energy on momentum, mostly advective transport.
    Large in boundary layers with large thermal/moisture gradients.
  \item[$J_{Ep}$] Thermal/moisture diffusion due to pressure-melting, $\uu \cdot \nabla$.
  \item[$J_{EE}$] Advection-diffusion for energy, very nonlinear at small regularization.
    Advection-dominated except in boundary layers and stagnant ice, often balanced in vertical.
  \end{itemize}
