\begin{frame}{Variational Inequalities}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Supports inequality and box constraints on solution variables.
  \item Solution methods
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Semismooth Newton
      \begin{itemize}
      \item reformulate problem as a non-smooth system, Newton on subdifferential
      \item Newton step solves diagonally perturbed systems
      \end{itemize}
    \item Active set
      \begin{itemize}
      \item similar linear algebra to solving PDE
      \item sometimes slower convergence or ``bouncing''
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item composes with multigrid and field-split
  \item demonstrated optimality for phase-field problems with millions of degrees of freedom
  \end{itemize}
