\Large Developing parallel, nontrivial PDE solvers that deliver high performance is still difficult and requires
months (or even years) of concentrated effort.

\medskip

PETSc is a toolkit that can ease these difficulties and reduce the development time, but it is not a black-box PDE
solver, nor a \blue{silver bullet}.
