\begin{frame}[shrink=5]{Rediscretized Multigrid using \texttt{DM}}
  \begin{itemize}
{\small
  \item \texttt{DM} manages problem data beyond purely algebraic objects
    \begin{itemize}
{\small
    \item structured, redundant, and (less mature) unstructured implementations in PETSc
    \item third-party implementations
}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{DMCoarsen(dmfine,coarse\_comm,\&coarsedm)} to create ``geometric'' coarse level
    \begin{itemize}
{\small
    \item Also \texttt{DMRefine()} for grid sequencing and convenience
    \item \texttt{DMCoarsenHookAdd()} for external clients to move resolution-dependent data for rediscretization and FAS
}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{DMCreateInterpolation(dmcoarse,dmfine,\&Interp,\&Rscale)}
    \begin{itemize}
{\small
    \item Usually uses geometric information, can be operator-dependent
    \item Can be improved subsequently, e.g. using energy-minimization from AMG
}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Resolution-dependent solver-specific callbacks use attribute caching on \texttt{DM}.
    \begin{itemize}
{\small
    \item Managed by solvers, not visible to users unless they need exotic things (e.g. custom homogenization, reduced models)
    %\item This implementation aspect is subject to change, but should not affect user interface.
}
    \end{itemize}
